Important points

If you possess digital money then you need a digital wallet.

A wallet is an address on the Blockchain.

A wallet is a public key.

Someone wanting to conduct a transaction must send a message with the transaction signed with their private key.

Before a transaction is approved it is checked by every node who vote on it in a special electronic way that is different to the elections that most countries have.

A transaction is placed in a block by miners who are special nodes.

The computers in the network holding the Blockchain are called nodes.

Miners place transactions in blocks in response to proof of work challenges.

After miners successfully 'seal off' a block of transaction, they receive a reward, which currently stands at 12.5 BTC, and they also get to keep a transaction fees Bitcoin holders pay.

Interaction is carried out on a Blockchain using rules built into the program of the Blockchain called protocols.

Cryptography is essential on Blockchains to thwart thieves who would like to hack into the Blockchain.

Cryptographic keys are made by key generators or keygens.

Keygens use very advanced mathematics involving prime numbers to create keys.

A block contains a timestamp, a reference to the previous block, the transactions and the computational problem that had to be solved before the block went on the Blockchain.

The distributed network of nodes that need to reach consensus makes fraud almost impossible within the Blockchain.

Consensus is the mecahnisim used to agree on the state of a blockchain.

What is proof of work
Proof-of-Work, or PoW, is the original consensus algorithm in a Blockchain network.

In Blockchain , this algorithm is used to confirm transactions and produce new blocks to the chain. With PoW, 
miners compete against each other to complete transactions on the network and get rewarded.

Mathematical puzzle in blockchain
It’s an issue that requires a lot of computational power to solve.

There are a lot of them, for instance:

hash function, or how to find the input knowing the output.
integer factorization, in other words, how to present a number as a multiplication of two other numbers.
guided tour puzzle protocol. If the server suspects a DoS attack, it requires a calculation of hash functions, 
for some nodes in a defined order. In this case, it’s a ‘how to find a chain of hash function values’ problem.

The answer to the PoW problem or mathematical equation is called hash.
